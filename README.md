## Overview
*Project Lambda* is an open research initiative exploring whether artificial agents can independently rediscover fundamental physical principles through observation, interaction, and adaptive reasoning.  

The project seeks to unify concepts from computational neuroscience, physics, and artificial intelligence to examine how machine systems may arrive at empirical laws similar to those discovered by human scientists.

---

## Objectives
- Design artificial agents capable of self-guided experimentation and observation.  
- Analyze the emergence of symbolic representations and laws from raw environmental data.  
- Investigate the limits of synthetic intelligence in rediscovering established physical principles.
