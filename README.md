## Overview
*Project Lambda* is an open research initiative exploring whether artificial agents can independently rediscover fundamental physical principles through observation, interaction, and adaptive reasoning.  

The project seeks to unify concepts from computational neuroscience, physics, and artificial intelligence to examine how machine systems may arrive at empirical laws similar to those discovered by human scientists.

---

## Objectives
- Design artificial agents capable of self-guided experimentation and observation.  
- Analyze the emergence of symbolic representations and laws from raw environmental data.  
- Investigate the limits of synthetic intelligence in rediscovering established physical principles.

---

## Repository Structure
- `include/` — Public headers exposed per domain (`math/`, `core/`, …).  
- `src/` — Engine and experiment implementations (entry point in `src/main.cpp`).  
- `scripts/` — Tooling helpers for formatting and static analysis.  
- `paper/` — Research notes, references, and experiment reports.  
- `STYLEGUIDE.md` — Canonical Project Lambda C++ style manifest.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- CMake ≥ 3.20
- A C++23 compiler (clang++ 17 / g++ 13 or newer)
- GLFW 3.x and GoogleTest discoverable by CMake
- `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` for style enforcement

### Configure & Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

### Tests
```bash
ctest --output-on-failure --test-dir build
```

---

## Development Workflow
- `cmake --build build --target format` — Apply the project clang-format profile.
- `cmake --build build --target lint` — Execute clang-tidy using `.clang-tidy`.
- `scripts/format.sh` / `scripts/lint.sh` — Direct access to the tooling from any shell.
- Follow `STYLEGUIDE.md` for naming, documentation, and architectural rules. Extend the guide when introducing new patterns.
